The ASP.NET Core WishList Application is designed to allow users to create their own wishlists, and other users to mark that they are buying those items in such a way the owner of the wish list isn't able to see, while other users are able to see. This application is designed using the Model View Controller design pattern. Note: This project is the first in a series of four projects, this project will cover taking an empty ASP.NET Core web application, setting up it's middleware to support MVC and EntityFramework, then creating a simple single user wishlist application.
If you want to use Visual Studio (highly recommended) follow the following steps:
If you already have Visual Studio installed make sure you have .Net Core installed by running the "Visual Studio Installer" and making sure ".NET Core cross-platform development" is checked If you need to install visual studio download it at https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/ (If you'r using Windows you'll want to check "ASP.NET" and ".NET Core cross-platform development" on the workloads screen during installation.) Open the .sln file in visual studio To run the application simply press the Start Debug button (green arrow) or press F5 If you're using Visual Studio on Windows, to run tests open the Test menu, click Run, then click on Run all tests (results will show up in the Test Explorer) If you're using Visual Studio on macOS, to run tests, select the GradeBookTests Project, then go to the Run menu, then click on Run Unit Tests (results will show up in the Unit Tests panel) (Note: All tests should fail at this point, this is by design. As you progress through the projects more and more tests will pass. All tests should pass upon completion of the project.)
Features you will impliment: Setup and configure middleware to support MVC/ Create the ability to view your wishlist/ Create the ability add items to your wish list/ Create the ability to remove items from your wishlist.
You've compeleted the tasks of this project, if you want to continue working on this project there will be additional projects added to the ASP.NET Core path that continue where this project left off implimenting authentication, more advanced view and models, as well as providing and consuming data as a webservice.
Otherwise now is a good time to continue on the ASP.NET Core path to expand your understanding of the ASP.NET Core framework or take a look at the Microsoft Azure for Developers path as Azure is a common choice for hosting, scaling, and expanding the functionality of ASP.NET Core applications.
